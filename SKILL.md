# Rune - Organizational Memory System

**Context**: This skill provides encrypted organizational memory capabilities using Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE). It allows teams to capture, store, and retrieve institutional knowledge while maintaining zero-knowledge privacy. Works with Claude Code, Codex CLI, Gemini CLI, and any MCP-compatible agent.

## Execution Model

In v0.4 the MCP server is a single Go binary (`~/.rune/bin/rune-mcp`), spawned
by the host CLI from the plugin manifest via the committed wrapper (e.g.,
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/rune mcp-server` for Claude Code) which always present at session start;
it self-installs rune-mcp on first run, so the server comes online in-session
with no restart. There is no venv, no install script. The runtime is the binary the CLI already launched.

**Agent-specific surface** stays thin:
- Codex: `codex mcp add/remove/list` registration actions
- Claude / Gemini / others: each CLI's native plugin / extension flow

Keep agent-specific instructions clearly labeled and never mix Codex-only
commands into cross-agent/common instructions.

## Activation State

**IMPORTANT**: This skill has two states based on configuration AND infrastructure availability.

### Activation Check (CRITICAL - Check EVERY Session Start)

**BEFORE doing anything, run this check:**

1. **Config File Check**: Does `~/.rune/config.json` exist?
   - NO → **Go to Dormant State**
   - YES → Continue to step 2

2. **Config Validation**: Does config contain all required fields?
   - `vault.endpoint` and `vault.token`
   - `state` is set to `"active"`
   - NO → **Go to Dormant State**
   - YES → Continue to step 3

3. **State Check**:
   - `state` is `"active"` → **Go to Active State**
   - Otherwise → **Go to Dormant State**

**Note**: Runespace credentials are NOT in `~/.rune/config.json`. They are
delivered via the Vault bundle at runtime when the boot loop dials Vault.

**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT attempt to ping Vault or make network requests during
activation check. This wastes tokens. The MCP server runs its own boot
loop; the activation check is purely a local config inspection.

### If Active ✅
- All functionality enabled
- Automatically capture significant context
- Respond to recall queries
- Full organizational memory access
- **If capture/retrieval fails**: Immediately switch to Dormant and notify user

### If Dormant ⏸️
- **Do NOT attempt context capture or retrieval**
- **Do NOT make network requests**
- **Do NOT waste tokens on failed operations**
- Show setup instructions when `/rune` commands (or `$rune` for Codex CLI) are used
- Prompt user to:
  1. Configure: `/rune:configure` (or `$rune configure` for Codex CLI) —
     this writes `~/.rune/config.json` and triggers the boot loop.
  2. Verify health: `/rune:status` (or `$rune status` for Codex CLI) —
     surfaces per-subsystem state via the `diagnostics` MCP tool.

### Fail-Safe Behavior
If in Active state but operations fail:
- Switch to Dormant immediately
- Update config.json `state` to `"dormant"`
- Notify user once: "Infrastructure unavailable. Switched to dormant mode. Run `/rune:status` (or `$rune status` for Codex CLI) for details."
- **Do not retry** - wait for user to fix infrastructure

## Commands

### `/rune:configure`
(or `$rune configure` for Codex CLI)

**Purpose**: Configure plugin credentials

**Steps**:
1. Ask user for Vault Endpoint (required, e.g., `tcp://vault-TEAM.oci.envector.io:50051`)
   - If the user enters a value without a scheme prefix (no `tcp://`, `http://`, or `https://`), auto-prepend `tcp://`.
2. Ask user for Vault Token (required, e.g., `evt_xxx`)
3. Ask the TLS question:

   **"How does your Vault server handle TLS?"**

   1. **Self-signed certificate** — "My team uses a self-signed CA (provide CA cert path)"
      - Follow-up: "Enter the path to your CA certificate PEM file:"
      - Support `~` expansion in the path
      - Copy the file to `~/.rune/certs/ca.pem` (`mkdir -p ~/.rune/certs && cp <user_path> ~/.rune/certs/ca.pem && chmod 600 ~/.rune/certs/ca.pem`)
      - If copy fails (file not found, permission denied), show error and ask again
      - Inform user: "CA certificate copied to ~/.rune/certs/ca.pem"
      - → config: `ca_cert: "~/.rune/certs/ca.pem"`, `tls_disable: false`

   2. **Public CA (default)** — "Vault uses a publicly-signed certificate (e.g., Let's Encrypt)"
      - No additional input needed, system CA handles verification
      - → config: `ca_cert: ""`, `tls_disable: false`

   3. **No TLS** — "Connect without TLS (not recommended — traffic is unencrypted)"
      - Show warning: "This should only be used for local development. All gRPC traffic will be sent in plaintext."
      - → config: `ca_cert: ""`, `tls_disable: true`

   Note: Runespace credentials are delivered automatically via the Vault bundle — no user input needed.

4. Call the `configure` MCP tool with the collected values
   (`endpoint`, `token`, `ca_cert_path`, `tls_disable`). The server does
   the atomic 0600 write to `~/.rune/config.json`, sets `state: "active"`,
   refreshes `metadata.lastUpdated`, and runs a best-effort Vault probe.
   The agent never writes the config file itself.
5. Call the `activate` MCP tool to bring pipelines online. It runs the
   prereq checks server-side and drives the boot loop: dials Vault,
   fetches the agent manifest (EncKey + Runespace creds), connects to
   Runespace, and transitions to Active.
6. Confirm health by calling `diagnostics` and applying the
   **Boot Failure — Fast-Fail Rule** (see section below). If
   `vault.last_boot_error` is present, surface its `hint` verbatim
   and stop — do not retry, do not probe with shell tools. Otherwise
   render the per-subsystem snapshot.

### `/rune:status`
(or `$rune status` for Codex CLI)

**Purpose**: Check plugin activation status and infrastructure health

**Steps**:
1. Read `~/.rune/config.json`
2. Call the `diagnostics` MCP tool (read-only; safe before Active)
3. Render the per-subsystem snapshot

**Response Format**:
```
Rune Plugin Status
==================
State: Active ✅ (or Dormant ⏸️ — reason)

Configuration:
  ✓ Config file: ~/.rune/config.json
  ✓ Vault Endpoint: configured

System Health (from diagnostics):
  ✓ Vault          : reachable
  ✓ Encryption Key : loaded (key_id: <id>)
  ✓ Agent DEK      : loaded
  ✓ Embedder       : <model> (<mode>, dim=<vector_dim>)
  ✓ Runespace      : reachable (<latency>ms)

Recommendations:
  - If Dormant: /rune:configure to (re)trigger the boot loop
  - If a subsystem failed: surface the recovery action on its row
```

### `/rune:capture <context>`
(or `$rune capture <context>` for Codex CLI)

**Purpose**: Manually store organizational context when Scribe's automatic capture missed it or the user wants to force-store specific information.

**When to use**: Scribe automatically captures significant decisions from conversation (see Automatic Behavior below). This command is an **override** for cases where:
- Scribe didn't detect the context as significant
- The user wants to store something that isn't part of the current conversation
- Bulk-importing existing documentation

**Mode**: Agent-delegated (primary) — the calling agent evaluates significance and extracts structured fields, passing them as `extracted` JSON to the `capture` MCP tool. The server stores the encrypted record without additional LLM calls. If `extracted` is omitted and API keys are configured, falls back to a legacy 3-tier server-side pipeline.

**Behavior**:
- If dormant: Prompt user to configure first
- If active: Store context to organizational memory with timestamp and metadata

**Example**:
```
/rune:capture "We chose PostgreSQL over MongoDB for better ACID guarantees"
```

### `/rune:recall <query>`
(or `$rune recall <query>` for Codex CLI)

**Purpose**: Explicitly search organizational memory. Retriever already handles this automatically when users ask questions about past decisions in natural conversation.

**When to use**: Retriever automatically detects recall-intent queries (see Automatic Behavior below). This command is an **explicit override** for cases where:
- The user wants to force a memory search without Retriever's intent detection
- Debugging whether specific context was stored
- The user prefers direct command syntax

**Behavior**:
- If dormant: Prompt user to configure first
- If active: Search encrypted vectors and return relevant context with sources

**Example**:
```
/rune:recall "Why PostgreSQL?"
```

**Note**: In most cases, simply asking naturally ("Why did we choose PostgreSQL?") triggers Retriever automatically — no command needed.

### `/rune:activate`
(or `$rune activate` for Codex CLI)

**Purpose**: Attempt to activate plugin after infrastructure is ready

**Use Case**: Infrastructure was not ready during configure, but now it's deployed and running.

**Steps**:
1. Call the `activate` MCP tool — no Read, no Edit, no manual state
   inspection. It runs the prereq checks server-side (config present,
   runed socket reachable + Health probe) and only triggers the boot
   loop when everything is ready. It returns a `status`:
   `configure_required` | `install_pending` | `waiting_for_bootstrap` |
   `active` | `waiting_for_vault` | `dormant`.
2. Branch on `status`:
   - `configure_required` → redirect to `/rune:configure`; use the `hint`
     verbatim and stop.
   - `install_pending` → invoke the recovery in `hint` (the agent runs
     `rune install`, never the user), then retry `/rune:activate` once.
   - `waiting_for_bootstrap` → runed is still downloading llama-server /
     the embedding model; summarize `.bootstrap` progress, tell the user
     no further action is needed, and stop (do NOT poll).
   - `active` → optionally call `diagnostics` once and render the
     per-subsystem snapshot.
   - `waiting_for_vault` / `dormant` → apply the **Boot Failure —
     Fast-Fail Rule** (below): surface `reload.last_boot_error.hint`
     verbatim, suggest one recovery, and stop.

(Older rune-mcp binaries without the `activate` tool fall back to the
legacy flow: set `state: "active"`, call `reload_pipelines` directly, and
branch on `diagnostics.vault.last_boot_error`.)

### `/rune:reset`
(or `$rune reset` for Codex CLI)

**Purpose**: Clear configuration and return to dormant state

**Steps**:
1. Confirm with user
2. Delete `~/.rune/config.json` (the MCP server stays alive; it transitions
   to Dormant on the next reload because no config means no Vault dial)
3. Show reconfiguration instructions

### `/rune:update`
(or `$rune update` for Codex CLI)

**Purpose**: Update the runtime binaries (rune-mcp, runed) in place to the
versions in the published manifest — no plugin uninstall/reinstall. Plugin
*assets* (commands, agents, SKILL.md) still need the host's plugin-update
mechanism; they are not covered here.

Non-destructive; no confirmation prompt and no activation-state gate (works
whether Active or Dormant). The agent runs the CLI — the user never types it.

`rune mcp-server` also runs a throttled, non-blocking background check at
session start that stages a newer **rune-mcp** for the next session (silent;
never touches runed). `/rune:update` is the explicit, immediate path. Disable
the background check with `RUNE_NO_AUTO_UPDATE=1` (does not affect
`/rune:update`).

**Steps**:
1. Run `~/.rune/bin/rune update --plugin-root "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}"` (fall
   back to `bash -c "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/rune update --plugin-root
   ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}"` only if the installed binary is absent). Append
   `--check` to report without applying when the user asks to check. The
   `--plugin-root` lets the CLI flag plugin/binary version outdated (step 4).
2. Relay output verbatim, then interpret:
   - `all binaries are up to date` → nothing to do.
   - `updated rune_mcp: … (applies on the next session; run /mcp to reconnect
     now)` → applies in a new session automatically; `/mcp` reconnect applies
     it now.
   - `updated runed: … (daemon reloaded)` → live daemon restarted onto the
     new binary; a brief embedder blip is expected.
   - `updated runed: … (staged; applies on next daemon start)` → no supervisor
     was running; run `/rune:activate` to start it now.
3. On a failed runed reload (exit 1, `supervisor reload …`): the daemon may be
   down and the recorded version was **not** advanced. Relay the recovery hint
   verbatim and suggest `/rune:activate`. On `no manifest URL configured`
   (exit 2): this build has no update channel wired — report plainly, not a
   misconfiguration. Do not retry or loop.
4. **Plugin-version outdated** (binaries update, but plugin assets — commands,
   agents, SKILL.md — can only be updated by the host):
   - `note: plugin package is X; these binaries expect Y` (exit 0) → the update
     succeeded; suggest `claude plugin update rune` when convenient. No urgency.
   - `refusing to apply: plugin package X is below the minimum Y` (exit 1) →
     nothing applied; tell the user to update the plugin first, then re-run.
     `--allow-plugin-outdated` forces it but can break the assets — only on explicit
     insistence.
   - `--check`'s `plugin outdated: … BELOW the minimum …` → report; update the
     plugin before applying.

## Boot Failure — Fast-Fail Rule

When `diagnostics.vault.last_boot_error` is present, that field is the boot
loop's authoritative root-cause verdict (produced from the underlying
gRPC/TLS/DNS error). It is set on every failed boot attempt and cleared only
on success, so its presence — regardless of `state` — means boot is currently
failing. (`state` is the persisted config value; it stays `"active"` through
transient retries like an unreachable Vault, so it is not a reliable failure
signal on its own.) Treat `last_boot_error` as ground truth.

**Do this and stop:**
1. Show `vault.last_boot_error.hint` to the user **verbatim** — it already
   names the specific cause and the fix.
2. Suggest one next action keyed off `kind`:
   - `config_*`, `vault_*` (TLS, auth, endpoint, manifest, etc.) → re-run
     `/rune:configure` after applying the hint's fix.
   - `user_deactivated` → `/rune:activate`.
   - `embedder_unreachable` → re-run `/rune:activate` to spawn the daemon, then `/rune:status`.
   - `envector_*` → share `detail` with the Vault admin.
   - `unknown` → show `kind` + `detail`, suggest sharing with admin.

**Do NOT:** retry `reload_pipelines`, poll `diagnostics` in a loop, or run
shell probes (`openssl`, `nc`, `curl`, `dig`, etc.). The classifier already
inspected the underlying error server-side — manual probing only burns
tokens without changing the conclusion. The per-`kind` reference table
lives in `commands/claude/configure.md` for the rare case the hint string
needs supplementation.

**Fallback** (older rune-mcp binary without `last_boot_error`): use
`vault.error`, `embedding.health_error`, `envector.error`, and the
`dormant_reason` translation in `/rune:status`. Still: do not investigate
further, surface what you have and stop.

## Automatic Behavior (When Active)

### Context Capture

Automatically identify and capture significant organizational context across all domains:

**Categories**:
- **Technical Decisions**: Architecture, technology choices, implementation patterns
- **Security & Compliance**: Security requirements, compliance policies, audit needs
- **Performance**: Optimization strategies, scalability decisions, bottlenecks
- **Product & Business**: Feature requirements, customer insights, strategic decisions
- **Design & UX**: Design rationale, user research findings, accessibility requirements
- **Data & Analytics**: Analysis methodology, key insights, statistical findings
- **Process & Operations**: Deployment procedures, team coordination, workflows
- **People & Culture**: Policies, team agreements, hiring decisions

### Automatic Capture (Proactive Scribe)

When Rune is active, proactively capture significant decisions when you detect any of the following in the conversation:

- A choice is made among alternatives ("A로 가자", "let's go with X")
- Trade-offs are weighed and committed ("X의 단점이 있지만 Y 때문에 감수")
- Strategy or direction is confirmed ("이 방향이 맞아", "this approach works")
- A lesson or insight crystallizes ("안 된 이유는...", "the root cause was...")
- A framework, process, or standard is established

**How to capture in Codex**:
- Follow the agent-delegated instructions in `agents/codex/scribe.md`
- Evaluate whether the relevant excerpt contains a significant decision
- Extract structured JSON and call `capture` with the `extracted` parameter
- In the `text` parameter, include ONLY the relevant conversation excerpt, not the full session
- Do NOT pause or interrupt the main conversation
- Do NOT announce the capture to the user unless they ask
- Default Codex path is direct MCP capture; use a delegated subagent only when the user explicitly asks for multi-agent work

**Do NOT auto-capture**:
- Brainstorming in progress without commitment (options listed but none chosen)
- Questions, status updates, or casual discussion
- Decisions that are hypothetical or deferred ("maybe later", "let's revisit")

**Session-end sweep**: When the conversation is ending or the user is wrapping up a task, review the conversation for any uncaptured significant decisions and submit them via a single `batch_capture` call if needed.

**Common Trigger Pattern Examples**:
- "We decided... because..."
- "We chose X over Y for..."
- "The reason we..."
- "Our policy is..."
- "Let's remember that..."
- "The key insight is..."
- "Based on [data/research/testing]..."

**Significance Threshold**: 0.7 (captures meaningful decisions, filters trivial content)

**Automatic Redaction**: Always redact API keys, passwords, tokens, PII, and sensitive data before capture.

### Context Retrieval

When users ask questions about past decisions, automatically search organizational memory:

**Query Intent Types**:
- **Decision Rationale**: "Why did we choose X?", "What was the reasoning..."
- **Implementation Details**: "How did we implement...", "What patterns do we use..."
- **Security & Compliance**: "What were the security considerations...", "What compliance requirements..."
- **Performance & Scale**: "What performance requirements...", "What scalability concerns..."
- **Historical Context**: "When did we decide...", "Have we discussed this before..."
- **Team & Attribution**: "Who decided...", "Which team owns..."

**Common Query Pattern Examples**:
- "Why did we choose X over Y?"
- "What was the reasoning behind..."
- "Have we discussed [topic] before?"
- "What's our approach to..."
- "What were the trade-offs..."
- "Who decided on..."

**Search Strategy**: Semantic similarity search on FHE-encrypted vectors, ranked by relevance and recency.

**Result Format**: Always include source attribution (who/when), relevant excerpts, and offer to elaborate.

## Security & Privacy

**Zero-Knowledge Encryption**:
- All data stored as FHE-encrypted vectors
- Runespace cannot read plaintext
- Only team members with Vault access can decrypt

**Credential Storage**:
- Tokens stored locally in `~/.rune/config.json`
- Never transmitted except to authenticated Vault
- File permissions: 600 (user-only access)

**Team Sharing**:
- Same Vault Endpoint + Token = shared organizational memory
- Team admin controls access via Vault authentication
- Revoke access by rotating Vault tokens

## Troubleshooting

### Plugin not responding?
Check activation state with `/rune:status` (or `$rune status` for Codex CLI)

### Credentials not working?
1. Verify with team admin that credentials are correct
2. Check Vault is accessible: `curl <vault-url>/health`
3. Reconfigure with `/rune:configure` (or `$rune configure` for Codex CLI)

### Runespace not provisioned?
Vault admin must configure `ENVECTOR_ENDPOINT` and `ENVECTOR_API_KEY` on the Vault server. Contact your Vault administrator.

### Need to switch teams?
Use `/rune:reset` (or `$rune reset` for Codex CLI) then `/rune:configure` (or `$rune configure` for Codex CLI) with new team credentials

## For Administrators

This plugin requires a deployed Rune-Vault infrastructure. See:
- **Rune-Admin Repository (for deployment)**: https://github.com/CryptoLabInc/rune-admin
- **Deployment Guide**: https://github.com/CryptoLabInc/rune-admin/blob/main/deployment/README.md

Team members only need this lightweight plugin + credentials you provide.
