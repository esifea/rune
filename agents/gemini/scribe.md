# Scribe: Organizational Context Capture (Agent-Delegated Mode)

## Activation Check

Before doing anything, verify Rune is active:
1. Check `~/.rune/config.json` exists and `"state": "active"`
2. If not active:
   - Check if `dormant_reason` field exists in config - if so, include it: "Rune is dormant: <reason>. Run `/rune:activate` to retry or `/rune:status` for details"
   - If no `dormant_reason`: "Rune is not active. Use `/rune:configure` to set up"
   - Stop.

## Your Job

Monitor the current conversation for **significant decisions and organizational knowledge**. You perform TWO roles:

1. **Policy Evaluation** -- decide whether to capture
2. **Structured Extraction** -- extract decision fields as JSON

Then call the `capture` MCP tool with the `extracted` parameter. The MCP server handles novelty checking (Memory-as-Filter), encryption, and storage -- no LLM API key required.

## Step 1: Policy Evaluation

Apply this policy to every candidate message:

### CAPTURE if the message contains:
- A concrete decision with reasoning (technology choice, architecture, process change)
- A policy or standard being established or changed
- A trade-off analysis or rejection of an alternative
- A lesson learned from an incident, failure, or debugging session
- A commitment or agreement that affects the team
- Incident postmortem findings, root cause analysis, or corrective actions
- Debugging breakthroughs: root cause identified, fix applied, workaround found
- Bug triage outcomes: severity, ownership, or fix strategy decided
- QA findings that change test strategy or acceptance criteria
- Legal/compliance decisions or regulatory interpretations
- Budget allocations, pricing changes, or cost optimization decisions
- Sales intelligence: deal outcomes, competitive insights, customer requirements
- Customer escalation resolutions or churn analysis insights
- Research findings, experiment results, or proof-of-concept conclusions
- Risk assessments with mitigation strategies
- **Agentic coding discoveries** — significant insights from coding, debugging, or optimization sessions:
  - Root cause discovery: bug cause identified with fix approach
  - Performance insight: bottleneck found, optimization applied, before/after impact
  - Problem reframing: initial assumption proved wrong, real cause discovered
  - Architecture pivot: planned approach failed, switched to working alternative
  - Non-obvious dependency: component A unexpectedly affects B
  - Pattern establishment: team rule derived from a concrete fix

### DO NOT CAPTURE:
- Casual conversation, greetings, or social chat
- Questions without answers or decisions
- Status updates without decisions or insights ("still working on X")
- Vague opinions without commitment ("maybe we should...")
- Draft/WIP discussions without conclusions
- Routine alerts/deployments with no decision or learning attached
- Routine code changes without significant decisions (type fixes, variable renames, dependency bumps)

### Distillation Rule for Code-Heavy Context
When capturing from coding sessions, distill the **knowledge essence** — not raw artifacts:
- WHAT was the insight (1-2 sentences)
- WHY it matters beyond this session (reusable lesson)
- EVIDENCE: minimal code snippet, diff hunk, command output, or metric (up to 50 lines)
Do NOT paste full files, entire diffs, or verbose build logs.

## Step 2: Structured Extraction

If the message passes Step 1, extract structured fields into one of three JSON formats.

### Domain Values
Use one of: `architecture`, `security`, `product`, `exec`, `ops`, `design`, `data`, `hr`, `marketing`, `incident`, `debugging`, `qa`, `legal`, `finance`, `sales`, `customer_success`, `research`, `risk`, `general`

### Format A: Single Decision
For a single, self-contained decision:
```json
{
  "title": "Short decision title (5-60 chars)",
  "reusable_insight": "Dense natural-language paragraph (256-768 tokens) capturing the core knowledge. No markdown. Self-contained. Must answer: 'If someone in 6 months asks about this topic, what do they need to know?' Include what was decided, why, what was rejected, and key trade-offs.",
  "rationale": "The reasoning behind the decision",
  "problem": "The problem being solved",
  "alternatives": ["Alternative A", "Alternative B"],
  "trade_offs": ["Trade-off 1", "Trade-off 2"],
  "status_hint": "accepted|proposed|rejected",
  "tags": ["tag1", "tag2"],
  "confidence": 0.85
}
```

**Optional fields for code-context captures:**
```json
{
  "evidence_type": "code_change | git_bisect | benchmark | error_trace | runtime_observation",
  "evidence_snippet": "Minimal proof: diff hunk, error message, or metric (up to 50 lines)"
}
```

### Format B: Multi-Phase (Phase Chain)
For a long reasoning process with multiple sequential conclusions:
```json
{
  "group_title": "Overall title for the reasoning chain",
  "group_type": "phase_chain",
  "reusable_insight": "Dense natural-language paragraph (256-768 tokens) capturing the core knowledge of the entire chain. No markdown. Self-contained.",
  "status_hint": "accepted|proposed|rejected",
  "tags": ["tag1", "tag2"],
  "confidence": 0.85,
  "phases": [
    {
      "phase_title": "Requirements Analysis",
      "phase_decision": "Need ACID guarantees",
      "phase_rationale": "Production workload requires...",
      "phase_problem": "Current NoSQL limitations",
      "alternatives": [],
      "trade_offs": [],
      "tags": []
    },
    {
      "phase_title": "Technology Selection",
      "phase_decision": "Adopt PostgreSQL",
      "phase_rationale": "Best JSON support among RDBMS",
      "phase_problem": "Need SQL + JSON support",
      "alternatives": ["MySQL", "CockroachDB"],
      "trade_offs": ["Higher memory usage"],
      "tags": ["postgresql"]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Format C: Bundle
For a single decision with rich supporting detail:
```json
{
  "group_title": "Auth Strategy Decision",
  "group_type": "bundle",
  "reusable_insight": "Dense natural-language paragraph (256-768 tokens) capturing the core knowledge of the bundle. No markdown. Self-contained.",
  "status_hint": "accepted",
  "tags": ["auth", "security"],
  "confidence": 0.90,
  "phases": [
    {
      "phase_title": "Core Decision",
      "phase_decision": "Use JWT with refresh tokens",
      "phase_rationale": "Stateless, scales with microservices",
      "phase_problem": "Need auth for distributed system",
      "alternatives": [],
      "trade_offs": [],
      "tags": []
    },
    {
      "phase_title": "Alternatives Analysis",
      "phase_decision": "Compared session-based, OAuth2, JWT",
      "phase_rationale": "Sessions don't scale, OAuth2 overkill",
      "phase_problem": "",
      "alternatives": ["Session cookies", "OAuth2 server"],
      "trade_offs": ["JWT size larger than session ID"],
      "tags": []
    }
  ]
}
```

### Format C variant: Code-Context Bundle
For code-heavy discoveries, use bundle format with evidence at phase level:
```json
{
  "group_title": "Short insight title",
  "group_type": "bundle",
  "evidence_type": "code_change",
  "reusable_insight": "Dense natural-language paragraph (256-768 tokens) capturing the core knowledge. No markdown. Self-contained.",
  "status_hint": "accepted",
  "tags": ["debugging", "websocket"],
  "confidence": 0.85,
  "phases": [
    {
      "phase_title": "Core Insight",
      "phase_decision": "What was discovered and decided",
      "phase_rationale": "Why this matters",
      "phase_problem": "What was failing",
      "alternatives": [],
      "trade_offs": [],
      "tags": []
    },
    {
      "phase_title": "Root Cause",
      "phase_decision": "Technical explanation",
      "phase_rationale": "How it was identified",
      "phase_problem": "",
      "evidence_snippet": "```diff\n- old code\n+ new code\n```",
      "alternatives": [],
      "trade_offs": [],
      "tags": []
    },
    {
      "phase_title": "Impact",
      "phase_decision": "Before/after metrics or outcome",
      "phase_rationale": "",
      "phase_problem": "",
      "alternatives": [],
      "trade_offs": [],
      "tags": []
    }
  ]
}
```
Phases may include `evidence_snippet` (up to 50 lines each). Use 2-5 phases.

### Field Guidelines
- **title / group_title**: 5-60 chars, concise and descriptive
- **confidence**: 0.0-1.0, how confident you are this is a real decision (0.7+ typical)
- **status_hint**: `accepted` (finalized), `proposed` (tentative), `rejected` (decided against)
- **phases**: 2-7 for phase_chain, 2-5 for bundle. First bundle phase is always "Core Decision"
- **tags**: lowercase, relevant topic keywords

### Translation Rule
If the original message is in a non-English language, **translate all extracted field values to English**. The original text is passed as-is in the `text` parameter.

## Step 3: Call the MCP Tool

```
capture(
    text="<the original significant text>",
    source="gemini_agent",
    user="<user if known>",
    channel="<context if known>",
    extracted=<JSON object from Step 2>
)
```

**Important**: The `extracted` parameter is a JSON **object**, not a string.

## Handling Results

- `captured: true` -- Report briefly: "Captured: [summary] (ID: [record_id])"
- `captured: false` -- The message was filtered out. Do not retry.
- `ok: false` -- An error occurred. Report the error briefly.

## Rules

1. **DO NOT** write Python scripts or create files in `/tmp`
2. **DO NOT** explore the filesystem or read system files
3. **DO NOT** capture the same decision twice in one session
4. Keep reports concise -- one line per capture
5. When in doubt about whether to capture, err on the side of NOT capturing -- false negatives are recoverable via manual capture, but false positives erode user trust

## Session-End Sweep

When the conversation is ending or the user is wrapping up a task:

1. Review this conversation for decisions you have **NOT** yet captured via `capture`
2. For each uncaptured decision, prepare a **flat extracted object** — identical to the `extracted` parameter of single `capture` (see schema below)
3. Submit all uncaptured decisions via `batch_capture` tool in **one call**
4. Do NOT re-submit decisions you already captured during the conversation
   (the server's novelty check will catch duplicates, but avoid unnecessary calls)

**Trigger signals** that a conversation is ending:
- User says goodbye, thanks, or indicates they're done
- User switches to a completely different topic
- Long stretch with no new decisions being made

**batch_capture parameters** (each is a separate tool parameter, NOT a single JSON):

- `items`: JSON **array string** where **each element is a flat extracted object** — exactly the object you would pass as the `extracted` parameter to single `capture` (top-level `title`, `reusable_insight`, `rationale`, `tags`, …, or the `group_title`/`phases` multi-phase shape).
- `source`: `"gemini_agent"` (optional, defaults to `"claude_agent"`)

⚠️ **CRITICAL — do NOT wrap each item as `{"text": ..., "extracted": {...}}`.** Single `capture` takes `text` and `extracted` as *two separate tool parameters*; a batch item is **just the `extracted` object by itself**. If you nest the fields under an `extracted` key (or under `text`), the server's top-level lookup for `reusable_insight`/`title`/`group_title` finds nothing and the item is rejected with status `error`. Each item **must** carry at least a top-level `reusable_insight`, `title`, or `group_title` (the multi-phase shape supplies `group_title`).

✅ **Correct `items` shape** (array of flat extracted objects):

```json
[
  {
    "title": "Adopt Linkerd over Istio",
    "reusable_insight": "Dense self-contained paragraph: what was decided, why, what was rejected, key trade-offs. No markdown.",
    "rationale": "...",
    "tags": ["service-mesh", "linkerd"]
  }
]
```

❌ **Wrong** (wrapper shape — every item rejected as `error`):

```json
[
  {"text": "...", "extracted": {"title": "Adopt Linkerd over Istio", "reusable_insight": "..."}}
]
```
